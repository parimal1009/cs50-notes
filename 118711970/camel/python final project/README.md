PasswordManager Class: This class serves as a manager for storing and handling passwords. It has methods for adding passwords, viewing saved passwords, and checking if a password meets certain criteria.

view_passwords() Method: This method displays all the saved passwords. If there are no passwords saved, it returns a message indicating so.

add_password() Method: This method adds a new password to the manager. Before adding, it checks if the password meets certain criteria using the is_valid_password() method. If the password is valid, it hashes the password and saves it along with the corresponding username.

is_valid_password() Method: This method checks if a password meets certain requirements. It uses a regular expression to enforce specific rules, such as minimum length and the presence of uppercase letters.

simple_hash() Method: This method hashes the password. However, it's intentionally simplified and not suitable for real-world use.

Testing: The project includes unit tests using the pytest framework. Each method in the PasswordManager class has corresponding test functions to ensure that they behave as expected. Additionally, intentional errors are introduced in the test cases and methods to demonstrate how testing can catch such issues.

Main Function (main()): This function demonstrates the usage of the PasswordManager class by adding passwords, viewing them, and attempting to add an invalid password. However, there's a typo in the if __name__ == "_main_": line, which should be if __name__ == "__main__": to execute the main function correctly.

Overall, the project provides a simple password management system along with comprehensive testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of the implemented features.
